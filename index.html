                <p class="overview">Hi! My name is Nell and I am 25 years old. I love to spend my time outside when the weather is nice with my friends. We like to do everything from riding bikes, to going to the beach! I also am currently working for a home fragrance company, which has been plenty of fun. However, I am ready for a change of scenery when it comes to my career. I have decided to dip my toes in the world of tech! </p>
    <h2>How I Got My Start</h2>
        <p>It wasn't until my older sister told me about SQL that I found myself getting interested in the world of coding. I decided to take an SQL course through a local college, and that was all it took to get me hooked. Here I am doing the thing! I've enrolled myself in the javascript bootcamp, and I'm so excited to see where it'll take me. I'm very grateful to be given this opportunity by Grand Circus!</p>
        <p>As odd as it sounds, I first heard of Grand Circus from one of my customers. We had gotten aquainted with eachother and found out that we had a mutual friend - a pottery instrcuctor that we had both previously taken classes from. Turns out this instructor was attending Grand Circus while I was learning SQL. I had been wanting to learn more about coding for a while, so I reached out to her to learn more... and the rest was history. <p>
